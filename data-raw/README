This folder contains the raw data required to produce the content of the "data" folder. 

To populate this folder, first download snapshot 1.4.0 of libraries.io dataset that can be found on https://zenodo.org/record/2536573, extract versions.csv and dependencies.csv for the selected ecosystem from this archive and run "python extract.py". 

This script will produce two new files: 
 - releases.csv.gz that contains the release informations;
 - dependencies.csv.gz that contains the dependency relationship informations.

These two files are required by the scripts present in the "data" folder.
