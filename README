This repository is the replication package of our study on backported updates in NPM. 

The list of dependencies required to execute the scripts is contained in `requirements.txt', and can be installed as usual with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. It is strongly advice to create an isolated environment with Python 3.5+ before running this command. 

The scripts are available in the `notebooks/` directory, and are expected to be open and executed with `jupyter`. 
The data required for these scripts depend on the chosen notebook. With the notable exception of "Prepare data", all notebooks require "dependents.csv.gz" and "required.csv.gz" to be in `data/`. These two files should be available in this repository.

These two files were generated using "Prepare data". This notebook requires "NPM-releases.csv.gz" and "NPM-dependencies.csv.gz" to be in `data/`. Since these files are to big to be shared in a git repository, they can be generated by executing `convert.py` in the `data/` folder. This script requires, in turn, two additional files from the `data-raw/` folder. Follow the instructions of `data-raw/README` to see how to generate them.
